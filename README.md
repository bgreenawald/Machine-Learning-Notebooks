# Machine Learning Notebooks

#### These are a series of Jupyter Notebooks based on the Udemy course "Machine Learning A-Z: Hands on Python & R in Data Science". These notebooks are mostly going to be annotated versions of the code provided trough the course to 
#### serve as a review and cheat sheet for the course. Original code for the course may be found at https://www.superdatascience.com/machine-learning/.
#### Code found on the notebooks may not match the code found on this site, as I intend to edit the code and add output where necessary to augment
#### the material.
